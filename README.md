# Receipts

Receipts management program.

This project serves two goals, which I hope won't conflict too much with each other:

1) A tool for my family to record receipts from their phones, where Excel is far too clumsy
2) A testbed for me to play with Vase, Datomic, re-frame, etc.

# Contributing

This is mostly a personal learning project. But, if you find it useful and want to help
it grow, I'm open to code contributions. Best to speak with me first; open an issue and
I'll get back to you.
